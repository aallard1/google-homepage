This project is in the Web Development 101 course on the Odin Project website. I will be making a non functioning web page using HTML and CSS to demonstrate the skills I have learned so far.

I have made some good progress, but I got stuck and I'm not sure where to go from here. I may come back to it later when I'm more experienced.
